# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. 
The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where fraudulent transactions account for only a small fraction of all transactions, making it highly imbalanced.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset file `credit_card_data.csv`.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Python script for data cleaning.
  - `model_training.py`: Python script for model training.
  - `model_evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model evaluation and validation.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Execution

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Run the data preprocessing script to clean the dataset:
   ```
   python src/data_cleaning.py
   ```
3. Execute the model training script to train the machine learning model:
   ```
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
